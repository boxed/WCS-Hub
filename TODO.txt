A complete WCS event system should have:
- Register an event instance online
    - Set up which competitions are available and the prices for the divisions
        Live preview of what the sign up form will look like later, both the onsite and online versions?
    - Publish/registration start date, registration end date
- Register online for different comps
- Register on site for different comps
	- Import from other sources?


- Computer support for comps
	- Prelims
	- Finals
	- Posting results

- Results display page
    - Different drill down based on event name, year, etc
